***Note/Disclaimer regarding the functionality***

Following the update to compass' terms of service, the website now blocks any web drivers and may potentially result in the suspension of student accounts who try to use one.
Furthermore, Reddit's terms of service has also recently updated regarding how its API may potentially be accessed, although the scraping functionality still works.
The Bureau of Metereology also requests that users use an API rather than scrape directly from the website, although again the scraping functionality still works.

The only service *to my knowledge* that hasn't prohibit scraping since is, of course, XKCD.
